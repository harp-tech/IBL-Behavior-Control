Add own image:
	Add the file to the visual studio project (not the solution).
	Change the file name to the namespace that you want (keeping the .svg extension).
	Note: You may need more than one file if you want to use it for more than one namespace.
	Click on the file under the visual studio Solution Explorer and, in the Properties, configure Build Action = Embedded Resource

User a Bonsai default icon to all the nodes:
	Go to AssemblyInfo.cs and add the next line to use the DAQ icon, for example.
	[assembly: WorkflowNamespaceIcon("Bonsai:ElementIcon.Daq")]
